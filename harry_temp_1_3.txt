10 samples at 1.3 temperature, trained for 7,000 steps on OpenAI's GPT-2

Note: The temperature is now 1.3 which is getting to a point where the output is very crazy and weird. The AI is being even bolder in its predictions and it generates stuff that makes no sense, often using words and phrases that have never appeared in the dataset it was trained on.

Hermione brought in an ear of ginger and crashed into 
Harry beneath an iris of stars. Opening their hair 
to stare absurdly at the wand, she muttered, “Oh no, 
Harry! Didn’t I do that Mister Penelope instructed me 
to lose my wand?”

Similar enthusiastic agreement splashed across 
Hermione ’s face as one. At once Harry twisted around on 
the spot to face her, wondering what she had seen and 
he felt an abiding sense of humiliation as scars spread 
indistemwise and burn told Harry that he had received 
second Class B. Even as he returned to his feet Hermione 
verbally kicked him under the armpits and pulled two 
end of wand twigs out. 

Hagrid had to be short for nature keepers, and absolutely 
fleeting he had summoned an ammonite. Cut off at 
mid air, it happened seriously fast; like being hit in the 
head with a basilisk fang, inactivate instantly, and a 
series of sickening bruises began to spread 
indistinctly, multiple sores below. Hardly aware 
of what he had done, Harry returned to the terror of 
Malfoy’s words and experienced the transient and 
fading debasing of reality faster than he could 
wish it, or how loss and fear began to pierce 
him, destabilize and burn, as before. Bad it felt, the

fetid and menacing as did judgement day. And then, 
as though hitting him was exactly the wrong thing to 
do, Lucius Malfoy dropped his hands irrevocably, and 
transformed.
