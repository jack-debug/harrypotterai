I swiveled around to face her, and got her 
gesture. 

“Come with me!” I moaned, and she smiled at me. 

I followed Hagrid down a side road, and found ourselves 
prowling among the recently uprooted tangle of 
roof clogs that formed one area, and the beds 
that had been crammed into many. Hagrid fitted us 
quite well, other teachers cavorted little in his 
teachers’ arms, and as we went around we saw 
more gillyweed stretching before their eyes, and 
the word “Tripping Over Tweaks” dangled 
over them. 

“With what?” Ron asked, peering around the 
edge of the hedge. “Ah, no, I suppose they take 
students off to train with weedy owls, they don’t 
usually come here for Octavius or Remus. What’s 
Dunno ... D’you reckon you could use a laugh rapping 
at the window?” 

“Dunno because I— what am I?” muttered 
Hermione. 

“Harry!” Harry said, horrified, and Ron shook his 
head, looking bewildered. “Don’t you think — ?”

“It’ll surprise you,” came Hermione’s all-encompassing 
smile. 



“It’ll be really fun,” said Harry, amused, and Ron 
stared. 

“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about 
Tripping Over Tweaks. ‘He borrowed a pair, he’s been 
hanging around trying to get a better grip — ’ I’d use it 
... he’s probably hoping you’ll be able to fix it — ” 

Hermione’s hand slipped through Crabbe ’s hair, 
and she snatched it up. Harry, throwing aside his 
thick, oily hair, kicked it away. Ron stared. 

“That doesn’t sound anything like how he intended it to 
word, it sounds more like — ” 

“Messing up his hair, ruining his shirt, or — ” 

Ginny and Tonks were panting from their rushes, and 
with great difficulty they reemerged, their skirts 
waisted and boneless.) 

“I won’t be laughing,” said Harry flatly. 

“No, seriously, I won’t,” Hermione told slow and 
ingrained glee. 

Ron was trying to say “thanks,” but his attempt was 
fading. Magorian came hurrying down the path, his 
hands full of books. 



Page | 284 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“ ’Bye!” he called loudly, and he dragged himself back 
into their circle. 

“Thanks,” Hermione repeated, changing into a slightly 
wider shade of magorian before Ron. Weasley appeared 
to slap her on the shoulder in mock exasperation. 

“Didn’t I tell you to call me Mr. Weasley?” asked 
Ginny, turning pink again. “I always use his 
name, I always give him first before anyone else.” 

“That’s brilliant of you!” yelled Ron, beaming at her. 
“You know Percy but not connected, you got him on the 
other side — now hold on — ” 

“What is this carriage and who are you?” 

“That’s Albus — dead — travelled by me — ” 

“Oh, Hagrid made you?” asked Ginny. 

“He’s my cousin!” puffed Magorian. “Cousins! 
Balance — so you wouldn’t need to go fishing with 
Hagrid!” 

“Good stuff to come from them, that coward,” 
shrieked Croakshanks, and he tossed the handful 
of books at them, falling, apparently, to

heard the unmistakable sounds of a body part 
saying, “Hi, Neville.” 



Smoke doubled, doubling, and then suddenly there 
was more than one person sitting right behind him, 
the top of the tree solidifying, forming a black 
herb almost like a gillyweed, covering all three of 
them in mist. 

“Let’s get out of here!” Hermione hurled 
herself into Harry’s arms. “As much as we mustn’t 
worry, how are you going to find it?” 

“Fine, thanks,” said Harry, but very reluctantly at 
her words a split second later Hermione bounded 
over his elbow, pulling him down onto the 
ground. 

“Don’t be so ridiculous!” yelled Ron, smashing his 
hand into Harry’s hip. “D’you think you could charm 
Cedric into letting you into his vault of stolen 

— ?” 

“No! He would never have let me in — ” shouted 
Hermione, contorted with rage as she flung 
Harry toward the ground, sputtering up at the 
air. 

“Hermione, I’m warning you — ” 

“I am not,” said Hermione, arms still wrapped 
around Harry’s shoulders. “I know he told you 
he didn’t want me, but — ” 

“NO!” shouted Ron, basking in the cool night air 
while Hermione bustled around him, 
arms wide and fists clenched. “Cedric won’t let you 
outsage his vault without permission, that old nutter! 
Just because he knows you’re here, how are 
you going to get in there to guarantee he won’t 
let you in again?” 



Page | 636 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“CAN’T!” screamed Harry, and several pins flew 
out of the ends of his jinxed hand and started 
pinning his ankle to the left ankle. 

“Hermione,” said Harry through clenched teeth, “think 
of your — don’t trade — !” 

Hermione had already run for it; swinging her right 
arm around, she kicked Harry hard in the face, 
making him stumble backward over his boot. 

“That’s our forfeit, Malfoy,” said Harry, thumbing 
himself up and down for a first photograph of Malfoy 
with his wand in his hand, flashing a red eye like a 
lion to ward off a gadfly that were changing his 
appearance. “We’ve lost by far the bottle of 
Dudley Dursley’s we’ve been searching for. ... Fenrir 
shouted we could’ve had him by moonlight. ...” 

“Silencel” 

Through the gloom, Harry glimpsed Fred and Ginny, 
probably sitting at the Gryffindor table, 
condensing the fright they had just caused into icicles 
of hot cocoa. Once or twice he caught George 
turning on the spot, trailing scarlet frosts, but he 
approached them with no confidence. On the other 
side of the pool were Neville and Dean, the red-haired 
Wizard from Hufflepuff who were conversing in whispers 



Page | 637 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




with their scarlet-clad friends. Confused and 
waiting to see what was going to happen, Harry looked 
around at both of them and saw a combination of 
ignorant smiles upon his face. 

“I said I’d help you,” Neville hissed to Harry as 
they began exchanging confused, pointed faces. “I know I 
shouldn’ta, I’ve heard worse. ...” 

“Says who?” said Harry, stunned. 

He felt rather than heard Nevil and Dean blame 
Neville
====================
Who cares about that kind of thing?” said Neville, sizing Snape up and down. “I bet they’ve 
just been feeling a bit silly for something to do. ...” 

“Snape,” said Harry firmly, “is a highly accomplished 
Imperius player, isn’t he?” 

“Now, now, boy!” cried Professor McGonagall, 
sparring her wings menacingly, “if you’re disturbing 
Snape while the Dark Lord’s close by, you’ll spark both 
my wrath and your own destruction! You see?" 

“I didn’t!” said Harry, wincing as though Professor 
McGonagall’s words had hit him hard on the ears. 
“I didn’t — I didn’t do it — I am not that — I am not 
that — Cornelius, find him — Cornelius, do it — ” 

“Harry, please!” said Professor McGonagall in a 
tear, but he did not seem to want to hear any more. 
“Where is Potter? Where is he?” 



Page | 387Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Back I went!” Harry added hastily, “after Malfoy but 
begged me to join the party — ” 

“Three points from Gryffindor!” said Professor 
McGonagall. 

“Well, that’s nice,” said Harry, almost resentfully, 
“but what’s he done with us?” 

“Keep yourself out of anyone else’s line of fire and 
you’ll be fine, eh?” said Professor McGonagall in 
a voice of blazing determination. “As long as it’s about 
weird stuff, he won’t be able to join in. Thought we 
might have a little chat — do you want to get out of 
the party, Harry?” 

“I ... yeah ...” 

Harry felt himself going red in the face. He could not reject 
this man; he was beyond reproach. 

“And where are you going from?” Professor McGonagall 
asked effectively, so that he did not have time to 
think. 

“Er ... I ... ah ...” Harry struggled for words, but 
Professor McGonagall did not yield. So he hauled him 
off to the dungeons and disappeared up from 
the floor, stumbling on tiptoe after him. 

“Fred and George,” said Professor McGonagall, frowning 
slightly, depositing him down at the deserted 
standing room on the fifteenth of October, that 
Hermione had decided to keep her word, and 

Page | 388Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




blocked any further progress made by asking various 
questions. “They’ve already taken him up to their 
room, have they?” 

“ ’Course,” said Harry at once. “I ’ave just been 
upstairs with them and they left me sitting in the 
garden, what’s up?” 

“Oh, doors and windows,” said Professor 
McGonagall grimly. “One of the'unt — you know 
— busiest weeks we’ve ever had here, lots of work. 
But you should be up in the hospital wing for the 
birthday party, it’s all part of your pre-birthday 
care routine, shouldn’t it? Come to that — ” 

“What — but no !” said Harry flatly. 

“Treat yourself,” said Professor McGonagall, looking in 
disbelief at him. “Pity you didn’t take the necessary 
steps to make this stop — ” 

“We never get detention,” Harry lied. “There’s the 
Kingsley — we get to keep eating and talking and 
doing _magic.” 

“Oh, come on,” said Hermione, watching him blow 
his

====================
 Unconference call updates, will Wizards keep calling even if the person is banned? 

“No,” Harry said flatly. “There will be no more calls. But don’t 
hang around. I’ve had enough.” 

The door banged closed behind him. Feeling 
ashamed and defeated, he watched Ron and Hermione 
play Ping- pong with a bad feeling in the pit of his 
stomach. He had hoped the new speaker would 
have come up with something better to say on the subject, 
but nothing yet seemed to have worked — perhaps 
the whole thing had been a ruse, a plea for attention, a 
girlish attempt to make the old man dance himself, a 
stunt . . . and now Ron came galloping back up to 
the podium, an egg to Hermione, evidently under the 
impression that he had done something very interesting 
 . . . but he seemed to be sinking just beneath the 
warmth of the room. 

“New speaker!” yelled a voice through the metal bars. 
“Hello, Harry!” 

It was Hermione Granger. 

“Oh hi,” said Harry and the grin spread wider 
around his face. 

“Chuck us some request for syntax, then,” said Ron. 
“Awesome,” said Hermione. “Er — after you’ve 
done with that of course you’ll want to talk 
Syntax with Harry!” 

Page | 606Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Er — right — now?” 

“Yes, now!” shouted Harry. 

“Oh no no, Harry will not be interested in that,” said 
Hermione, leaving the booth complaining loudly and 
glaring at Ron. “I mean, how many people are in 
the Wizarding world that can say they invented 
something like Quaffle or Ludo Bagman?” 

“Yeah,” sighed Harry. 

“And we all know you dreamed up those two, only 
you’ve never found them up for display, have you?” 
shrieked Hermione. “Because you know they are 
unspeakable, so why on earth would you want to 
display ‘Reckon She’s Evil’ around some young meister 
of mine?” 

“Maybe he doesn’t have to leave the booth at all, if I’m 
half-ashamed a prat,” said Ron foolishly, grinning at 
all the talk. “For one thing, he wouldn’t have liked 
the subject matter, he’d have preferred to do 
work in Polyjuice. So ...” He sighed, than broke 
into an uncharacteristically brief Tumblr rant. “No 
one really knows what he’s saying anymore. I think 
he just — that’s one theory, even if he would say 
his sob story was true — made a mess of things, 
acted until the speaker was red in the face, everyone 
heard it, and everyone thought it must have been 
a really bad dream. But there are other things 
worrying about — well, Dobby was probably causing 
that to happen, that’s just the first theory — about the

number two,” he sighed. “Number two is” — he 
altered his spacing to make it three times — “not 
another time ... but we need to plan for it ... so the 
first thing we are going to do is talk to Ron and 
Hermione. Of course, if either of them decline, that 
doesn’t mean the need to speak to them is gone. 

“ Fortunately, they have other people to talk to besides 
themselves. It’s such a small group of people, though 
it’s growing — you know what I’m going to say to them? 
They ought to be able to hear the talk of some other

“Er,” Harry said fairly, starting to wish he had 
arrived on time. “Yes. Well, that makes it quite a 
beauty. They
====================
Description

If the identification of a Potione more probable than you is hopeless, aside from the fact that it is Unpredictable Too and You Can Mean Worst To Me Then, the answer is always, if I were you, , — a wise maxim, considering the fact that it is - MINISTRY OF THE MURDER EMBASSY, but I never had the faintest idea that I would come to that conclusion, and know how to prevent it. No, at the time I made the discovery, it seemed to me that the only thing we could do was to trust Muggle-borns and wisest in wizards. 



“Naturally, the Ministry’s reaction was immediate and severe,” Harry told Professor McGonagall. “After all the assurances they made to me, I was forced to believe that they meant what they were saying. It seemed inconceivable to me that they had come to expect me to act as Minister of Magic given the assurances I had given them ... though of course I had no power to stop it, and any ill will I might have felt toward Fred and George I am sure the Ministry would find a way to channel it into something productive. I can only hope that my subversive activities do not come to light any time soon, because the longer they let him and Mr. Weasley off on the outside, the happier I shall be. Oh, yes, I could not be more relieved to hear that the counterattack against you did not produce the desired effect! Do please do me a favor and do me justice ... for if I have offended you in anything I have said, I am so sorry. I trust you as a friend and as a faithful servant.” 

“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall, casting a venomous look at Harry and Ron as she sauntered back to her seat, “he was not your friend, now Pomona. … Now, I can’t say enough about Draco Malfoy. I can’t remember ever meeting someone who comes across Dumbledore who’s so vile an individual that he deserved his reputation as bad — ” 

Page | 340Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“EXPULSIVE INFORMATION!” roared Fred Weasley. 

“Fellow have your book!” shouted George. 

“Let me see!” shouted Harry. 

“Get out!” said Professor McGonagall sharply, her voice rising 
clearer than ever. “No!” moaned Ron. “Do it, Harry, or I might 
unseat you!” 

“Good day to you!” shouted Fred as she 
straightened up and swept across, round, and round the 
court. 

Few people were going to suggest that Cornelius Fudge, 
head of the Department for the Regulation and 
Control of Magical Creatures, was an untrustworthy 
employee at this, but Harry felt a bit awkward introducing 
him into the world of Magical Law. If you were going to 
imagine Fudge as a truly admirable man, he would 
have been a menace to Harry so far-fetched as to 
depict him as a bald old man with a bit of a 
hunch. A shrewd, shrewd man would be able to see that an 
incredible job was coming his way; he would not want 
my help, and certainly not now. 

“Words can’t describe how excited and pleased I am that 
class is over!” said Professor McGonagall brightly as 
they walked across the entrance hall. “Let me — ” 

“I don’t need your help!” Harry said unexpectedly to 
Professor McGonagall, who and Professor McGonagall 
made an odd, rolling-their-eyes sort of noise and 
shrieked. “We did fantastic stuff, you know, didn’t 
you see—Judge — JUDGE — OWL —” 

“What?” said both of them. 

Page | 341Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I know you were amazing!” said Harry. 



“This is a formal notice, Minerva,” said Professor 
McGonagall very brightly, glancing out to see what was 
commencing at the front of the Hall, “that Mr. Jasper 
Ferguson will be giving a presentation on legal 
arguments in our defense against Wizengamot 
imprisonments.�
====================
What I did.” 

“What did you see?” 

“Everything, all around me,” said Mr. Weasley, apparently 
thoroughly enjoying himself. “You know, even in 
the blank period when Umbridge was covering 
up — ” 

“You just kept looking right at her until she found — ” 

“I never knew you two got off on such rubbish!” Harry 
told Mr. Weasley without understanding what he was 
saying. 

“That’s right, it was absolutely rubbish but she just 
didn’t have — ” 

“I’m John, you know — ” 

“John\” snarled the youngest Weasley. “Not anymore, 
isn’t it?”

Harry figured that he would be able to dispel this 
all within a few weeks. He persuaded Ron and 
Hermione to follow him, and Harry to use his own 
eyesight; he waved good night to them as he 
walked past through the doors of number four and 
three at the Ministry of Magic. He had in mind 
making it onto the street again, but the sensation 
of standing there in the vast black ball for an 
entire circle to see out of him wore on him 
for days. 

He had once before had to stand up in front of the 
Ministry workers Bent all of them, suffered a 
mini-stroke, and later that year had to hold a mug 
amongst half a dozen stunted, slimy horseless 
broomsticks in his hand. Here and there 
encounters with the Ministry workers grew more and 
more frequent as he advanced, and some of them 
persuaded him to spill his drink in front of their 
ignorant eyes. But no matter: Mr. Weasley had taken 
Harry on quietly, softly, allowing invisible throngs 
to pour upon him over the Ministry workers’ 
stretched hands, and Harry had nothing more to say 
so than invite the looking crowd to a huddle in the 
entrance hall, which had already been full of 
fuming senior officials, to talk to him. 

He had expected higher morale to spring 
then. He and Ron had bullied the bloke who 
had taken Harry to the hospital wing into suggesting it 
beamed a positive energy back at them, and 
Dumbledore were both expecting overwhelming 
support from their supporters, all their pride and 
confidence. Their exam results came the 
following day, and while Harry was relieved to 
see that he did not waste his time nor Ron’s time 
expelling him, he was doubtful to be so fortunate 
again. The exam results also showed that he had 
rather outstripped Crabbe than Goyle in all the 
science questions (though both of them were still 
chances to fail) and that he had almost double 
Slytherin’s average in Charms. Three months 
along came the problem of Homework — 
homework questions were determined by a new 
set of criteria that banned students logging on to 
the internet or doing secret 

Page | 194 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




scrubbed searches. 

“Those questions would sort you into one of the 
higher castes?” Ron muttered, trying his best to 
turn out an infinite supply of Stinks — more 
breathing harder than Harry had ever achieved — and 

“I don’t believe it,” Harry whispered desperately. “I’ve 
dodged him twice now — firstly, he thought my name 
was a grapefruit — then he mistook me for that 
Someone wasn’t giving their name that well either. 

Then I went for his Head to see if he erred in his 
test — he took a stage.” 

The top drawer of the cabinet burst open like a 
quake and a dozen masked Death Eaters 
engulfed the four educationists. They were firing their 
wands, raising the heavy wooden spoons, waving the 
Invisibility Cloak from shoulder to hip. Nobody 
froze, but the shocked shouts just continued to pour 
through the corridors and by the time the 
smoke cleared
====================
You are not drinking up! You know you can do better than 
Harry Potter!” 

But a young man sitting lonely at the table was 
reverberating, almost in weeping, how he had been 
set upon by the whole gang of dementors. 

“Who attacked you?” he demanded. “Why couldn’t I 
turn you in?” 

“The dementors did it,” said Harry, “yes, the 
dementors do like to torment the repentant, don’t 
they? Well, one of them had magic to make the 
forage work impossible for me, and once my case was 
ground zero, the whole Ministry were exposed, 
and I had to answer to the whole Ministry! It’s 



He broke off, and so did Dumbledore. The blunder was 
so deeply engraved in Sirius’s memory that even now 
he would sit in silence with his hand over his 
eyes, humming happily as he reminisced. 

A time had come when they would have to find a way 
of putting an end to it, but that time did not 
come . . . and now, from so many miles away, these 
climates had collided ... or were they just a 
reduced forest, behind a castle wall, and Harry 
leapt lightly into the air to have a word with 
something that was right ahead of him? He felt light as 
flesh, and yet oh, what would happen if he threw 
off this feeling too easily? 

All he could do was to glide, dizzy,, the great 
silent void, and on any other surface he might 
have gone and said something grateful, but he had 
not thought of anyone to whom he could give an 
answer. For some reason, floating seemed to be his 
favorite mode of transportation on which to spend 
an hour that could bring Sirius’s surprise visit, and 
he was much more careless on land, where there 
was much less concern for his safety and much 
break more easily. Nevertheless, Sirius had told him 
in no uncertain terms that nothing else would make 
Harry miss Sirius, and in the evenings, when he 
shripped his way up to the Gryffindor common room, 
he would sit beside Sirius and talk alone. “That 
manservant” — Sirius had called him when Harry 
had first talked to him — “what do you want with 
us?” 

“I’m not sure,” said Harry tightly, as Sirius asked, 
“Are you sevin’ to join us?” 



Page | 715 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




“Thought it would be enjoyin’ one o’ the many perks,” 
said Sirius. “Like many famil’s we have now, we stays 
in the village an’ calls on us, an’ has ter invite us for 
partners instead of holiday.” 



“Who exactly are you pairing up with?” Harry asked. 

“Not everyone, mind, just — well — people — duh!” 

Sirius thrust his hand into the air and Jeff and Fleur 
fell silent at once. 

“Aberforth, he left us,” Harry said quietly. 

“Leave you out of this, then,” snapped Sirius, his last 
grip tightening on the door handle. 

Harry looked down at the back of his hand, thinking. 
Something sparkled there — a telling sign. He grasped 
it as he glanced at the back of his — 

“I want you first,” he told Dumbledore, and his fist 
shot into the air. 

“No!” said Sirius, tensing, his face burning. “Be 
skilled in your divination homework, I do not want thi’ 
pot on the fourth night of our double Potions lessons.” 

“We need a bit of practice,” said Harry, leaning 
forward in his eagerness to face the flickering light of 
Sirius’s wand. 

“There you go, if anyone needs reminders what to 
generate, Harry — bring an egg first, then an 
apple peel — ”
====================
somewhere in there -” said Harry. 

They turned a corner, the wind whipping the tree, 
branches rattling through the air. What with a whirl 
of swirling colors and sounds they saw again, 
with bright, greenish lights, not unlike those that 
would fill the room if Dumbledore really had 
returned. They had no time to relax as the warlocks 
whipped them open and the heat leapt noiselessly 
from their faces to their hands. They repeated the 
spell they had used to thwart Misrid being tempted 
by the gold figurine—but this time, it worked. 

The flame-filled room was cold, still smoking, 
and smelled very strongly of mold. Small talk had 
gone out of fashion, as though these were all odd 
manners and gambles. Harry felt cold sweat 
stopping his heart pounding fast. They were trying 
something new, and he wanted to try it, and though 
at first he had thought it had worked because he 
had spoken clearly and pointedly of a crystal ball, 
he was quickly learning to count on his fingers. 
Voldemort was back, and so was an ancient and 
feared curse. Harry simply had to hold his breath, 
and take three powerful, even incantations, 
from his lips: “ Expelliarmus, V.” He shouted that 
ceiling collapsed and the room became still again. 

“ Expelliarmus ?” Ron shouted, half laughing, half 
tears of laughter spilling down his face. 

“ It works too!” Harry shouted. “You can 
expelliarmus! ” 



Page | 617 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He felt his breath in his ears — keen on the idea, 
he raised his wand — 

“ Expelliarmusr V?” 

Nothing happened — neither did his smoke fill 
room, nor the one in his pocket, nor the ring 
between his fingers. He looked up and saw Ron and 
Hermione covered in droplets of sweat, both of them 



“ Wow!” said Ron, leaning back. “Awesome!” 

“That’s amazing.” said Hermione in relief, watching 
Ron. “Wow. Someone did recognize that voice, and it 
was brilliant!” 

“That was Dumbledore, that was,” said Harry, 
wanting to tell them what was going on, but too 
conciously to form any coherent thought. He had 
always thought Dumbledore was ... or was it a 
newman? Something about those two sentences 
kept cluttering his brain, and he had been running 
earlier and faster just to reach them. ... He was 
reasonably sure that he had crossed over — though here 
and there had been no sign of a body ... and he felt 
himself going pale and losing track of things as he 
moved swiftly through the midst of the crowd, making 
diplomatic overtures to the men and pointing, in 
Arithmancy, at the doxies that had descended, darting 
between the doxies and creeping shadows that 
normally filled the square. . . . 

“Was he being honored?” asked Hermione, staring at 
Harry over the rim of her goblet. 

“Oh, yeah, this was his bit of fun,” said Harry. 

“And what did it feel like?” asked Ron emotionally. 



Page | 618 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know,” Harry said, but with difficulty, because 
he knew that if he said too much, the crowd around 
him glowed red and turned on him just as he 
moved across their course to join the Ladybug. “It was good 
fun until he turned up in our direction and held us 
back.” 

“He thought he was being cowardly?” asked Ron, 
interrupting Harry loudly. “Are you calling him a coward?” 

“Well ... no, he seemed pretty sincere,” said Harry, 
and Ron immersed his face in tea, taking deep 
dive after the cool liquid that filled his mug. “But

extreme…blushing and outrage and alarm — You must 
ponder, however, what could you have been doing that 
night that night that woke you, and caused you to 
wake up here instead of at the Top Box? And you take 
the mystery even deeper from here, to the point where 
you consider trying to fashion a theory about 
who the mysterious visitor was, what he/she was

Draco Malfoy, Hogwarts prefect and head of Gryffindor 
House stormed up the table yelling at Crabbe, 
Chocolate, and Grog. A dozen shrieking and 
screaming Gryffindors crowded around his head, 

narrowing him out and pushing him into the 
sidedges of the chairs. When he opened his mouth to 
bait, none dared speak more than his mother — 

Harry gasped, sprang to his feet, flopped down into a 
seat along the packed table, and waited, panting 
and threatening to scuttle into the corridor for Sirius, 
who walked quickly to their table, swigging some 
butterbeer, snapping at Malfoy a defiant “No!” that 
sounded as though he was covered in Filibuster, and 
muttered an incantation that was only understood by 
the Hufflepuffs about a dozen loudly field- 
marshmallow-pink eyed monsters —

Sirius sat down at the Gryffindor table in an armchair 
beside where he had been shown waiting for Moody, 
barking his little head and laughing like a pig on a 
roar of laughter (“Merlin’s beard, chappie, with his 
hair...”). When Slytherins, who were coming from 
the other end of the table, saw Harry coming to theirs, 
they all turned tail and started wiggling fingers. 

“Er,” said Harry as he left the table again; he didn’t 
want to keep staring them all out of the office. He 
Aragog-ed the butterbeer, hefted his hefted glass 
at the ceiling and continued to drink deeply. 

Eventually, after a quarter of a dozen weak 
butterscotch-s, he reminded them all that he would soon 
be leaving again. He croaked, “The Triwizard is drawing 
to a close! Tell your friends I’m leaving.” 

He flung his arms convulsively over his head and 
hopped off the table. 

“Merlin’s beard,” Malfoy called loudly as he, too, 
drunk straight off. “Merlin’s beard, what is that?” 

And the crush of Slytherins pressed hard on him as 
he left. 

“Merlissa,” said Bagman happily, looking around as 
he ran ahead to collect his Muggle friends, “who doesn’t 
think you’d make a mistake sharing the secret of 
Moody’s bike?” 

“Well,” said Lupin, stopping in the corridor a little 
nearer, “I don’t think she asks too many questions, I’ll tell 
yeh that, Dumbledore’s hidden something awful — ”

“Hermione’s the one who always forgets how to get 
what she needs,” said Harry bluntly. “Cut her some 
more butterbeer, and you may have it.” 

“Bye-bye,” said Ron imperiously, and the four of 
them set off together again. 

“I think most people would have agreed that sharing a 
tiny, dangerous joke with a fellow wizard would be 
a bit foolish, you know,” said Bagman. “Not when the 
other wizard was so obviously incorrigible to sneak 
something around behind someone�

Harry barely heard them. They had crossed the border 
just beyond the Boundary Waters, crumpled up the 
bits of mud that still clung to their clothes in a last-ditch 
struggle attempt to cover up the trouble they had 
been caused, and tried to suggest that they move 
into one of the safer houses. Nobody was very 
happy about this idea, even though few seemed willing 
to take the risk. Hermione and Ginny did not seem happy 
either. 

“No,” said Ron, by way of an answer, “you make it 
sound like you wanted to come along, so you’ll have 
to leave us in peace.” 

“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione, looking 
alarmed, “you can’t give that to someone who badly 
wanted to come along! You said it yourself, we can’t 
pretend not to know who — ”

“Come out and talk about it, then!” said Harry 
fiercely. 

“ — who badly wanted to come along, you say?” 
said Hermione with sudden urgency. “Well, I 
there you are, and I’m not so keen on giving it to 
people who can’t even chieve a living — ” 

“I don’t care,” said Harry coldly. “It’s the truth. 

I know Sirius is as good as your father, and I’m sure 
he wants to come along with you.” 

“You’re nuts,” said Hermione, in a tone of 
fierce accusation. “If he doesn’t want to come along 
with you, he won’t bother.” 

“Come with you what?” 

“Oh, he just wants to talk about how he’s had 
to look at Ginny more often than he wants to,” 
said Hermione heatedly. 

“Actually, you just said that he wants to,” said 
Harry, with another unnecessary jolt of outrage. 
“You know, I’ve been wondering about that , all 
evening, have you?” 

“What do you want to talk about?” said Hermione 
stiffly. 

“I’ve heard he wants to talk about his dad, you know,” 
said Harry, with a sort of confession. 

“Yeah, well, we’re not going to try and persuade 
him to come along just now, are we?” said Ron. “I 
dunno. It looks like he might turn up. Listen,” he 
added hastily as Hermione glanced suspiciously at Uncle 
Vernon’s wrinkled shoulder, “Can you see what the 
Dursleys are like?” 

“What d’you mean?” roared Harry. “They’re 
abysmally rude!”

“Voucher for harder work,” muttered Ron. 

Pigwidgeon flapped his filthy wings irritably and 
knocked Harry upside deakily on the head. 

“ Time for bed!” said Harry impatiently, trying to clear 
his mind. “Or is there a way we can get him round 
the office?” 

“We know that,” said Ron defiantly. “It’s just a 
difficult problem. How do I convince him he’s being 
stole from the Department of Mysteries?” 

“I’ll do it,” said Harry. “So that’s two — I got two 
what-you-know-d’you?” 

“Listen, if it’s the Department of Mysteries he wants, I’ll 
take him and shove it,” said Ron, going red. 

“What? Thinks we ought to have a bit of a 
goblin raid taking?”
